# DesignPatternPractice
This is a practice project to learn various design pattern with real problem and its solutions

# Classification of patterns
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. 
- Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Creational Design Patterns
Factory Pattern (Factory Method) - provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

1. Abstract Factory - a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. Builder - a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.

3. Prototype - a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

4. Singleton - a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

# Structural Design Patterns

1. Adapter - a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

2. Bridge - a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

3. Decorator (almost similar to Proxy Pattern) - a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

4. Facade - a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

5. Proxy - a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Behavioral Design Patterns

1. Chain of Responsibility - a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
