/**
 * Ref# https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype
 * Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects
 * without making your code dependent on their classes.
 *
 * The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned.
 *
 * The implementation of the clone method is very similar in all classes.
 * The method creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field
 * values of the old object into the new one.
 *
 * Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes
 * of objects that you need to copy.
